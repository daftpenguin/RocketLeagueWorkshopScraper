Check the Workshop description for Changelog and Update Instructions\n-----\nRL Racing Royale\n isn't just a single small Map, it is aiming to establish a \nnew Gamemode\n into the Rocket Leauge universe: \nMultiplayer Racing\n - by mixing the best gameplay features from Rocket League and your favourite kart racing games!\nFeatures:\n \n Multiplayer Racing with support for up to 10 Players\n \n completely custom ingame Menu and HUD with custom Scoreboard, Minimap and more!\n \n for now featuring one single race track (rc_Lake) for public testing, but more tracks comming very soon\n \n racing framework easily extendable, so other devs can integrate new tracks without the need to code (other than very very few basic Kismet nodes)\nHow to Play:\nPSA: The map itself is not really playable without two extra steps!\nStep 1:\n \nProblem:\n The Framework uses Level Streaming to load in only the necessary files (-> only the active race track), but without (manual) changes RL will crash, because it cant find the track and its dependencies.\n \nSolution:\n\t\t[Copy track files into  ...\\*STEAM*\\SteamApps\\common\\rocketleague\\TAGame\\CookedPCConsole by hand (-> extra HDD space needed)]\n \n \nOR\n \n\t\t[create symbolic links in ...\\*STEAM*\\SteamApps\\common\\rocketleague\\TAGame\\CookedPCConsole to point to your workshop folder (where this mod will get dl'ed by steam: *STEAM*\\SteamApps\\workshop\\content\\252950\\1287922725)(-> no extra HDD space needed)]\n \n \nOR\n \n \n(preferred) \n[use my [i]Install.bat[/i] inside the workshop folder (*STEAM*\\SteamApps\\workshop\\content\\252950\\1287922725) to automatically create the above mentioned symbolic links. \nPSA: don't blindly execute the .bat if you don't trust my files/don't understand the code!\n]\n \ncode from Install.bat\n \n@ECHO OFF\n\n:: // Switching from Workshop folder into RL main folder\ncd....\ncd..\ncd..\ncd..\ncd..\ncd %cd%\\common\\rocketleague\\TAGame\\CookedPCConsole\necho RL Folder: %cd%\necho ...\n\n:: // calling \"CreateRLFolderLink\"(function) for each file needed (definition below)\n\ncall:CreateRLFolderLink RR_Assets_KHS.upk\ncall:CreateRLFolderLink RR_Assets_Lake.upk\ncall:CreateRLFolderLink RR_KHS_Mats.upk\ncall:CreateRLFolderLink RR_Prefabs_KHS.upk\ncall:CreateRLFolderLink RR_rc_lake.upk\ncall:CreateRLFolderLink RR_VersionInfo.upk\n\n\npause\n\n\n\n:: // Function definition \"CreateRLFolderLink\"\n\n:CreateRLFolderLink\n:: // \"%~1\" = Filename passed by function call (from above)\necho File: %~1\n:// Deleting old Link \ndel %~1\n:// Creating new Link; (\"%~dp0\" = folder, where the batch file is = workshop folder)\nmklink /H %~1 \"%~dp0\\%~1\"\necho ...\n\n\nStep 2:\n\tfor meaningful gameplay use \nRocket Launcher\n\trecommended settings: unlimited  time, default boost\n \nHow to start a racetrack after loading up:\nOnly the Host can control the ingame Menu!

Also, support files are not working at the moment either, so sorry for the poor visuals!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWater Polo in Rocket League, with custom water physics!\nGame Mechanics:\nBoost refills constantly (slowly), but refills faster in the water.\nBoost refills to 100% percent when hitting the water.\nBoost is more powerful underwater. Walls are slightly less sticky under water.\nBoost time for full boost is 20% longer, but only activates after the first goal (minor bug).\nDodge/jump resets when either entering or exiting the water. \nDodge/jump reset timer is infinite so you can use your flip no matter how long you have been in the air.\nWater Physics:\nMax speed in the water is set to around 2000uu which is slightly below supersonic, but the boost is faster so you can enter supersonic the second you leave the water. It allows for much more control whilst in the water (to the point that I can dribble the ball in the water, and I am not even that good!).\n'Water' is a gravity volume flipped upside down (650m/s, the opposite of RL gravity)\nWhilst in the water, the velocity is reduced on the car in all directions by 2%, 20 times a second. This causes the drag (but I do need feedback on this!)\nWhen the car enters the water, the angle of entry is calculated, converted to a percentage and applied to the velocity within some boundaries. Anything over a '80% perfect dive', so the middle 36\u00b0, will not affect the velocity. Anything below a '60% perfect dive', so the angles outside of the 54\u00b0 range either side, will slow the car by 40% in the z-axis. The angles in between these values will use the percentage as a multiplier for the velocity so a '70% percent perfect dive' will slow the car by 30%. This works whether the nose of the back of the car enters first. (Sorry for the confusing description! Just ask if it is not clear).\nThis is my first map of any kind, so I would appreciate as much feedback as possible. \nPlanned updates:\nTweak water - more drag? Slow rotation of ball (Thanks FerrumVulpes for the idea)\nAdd ball skipping/skimming\nBoats...?\nKnown Bugs:\nSpawns sometime put you on the wrong side\nBoost length increase only activated after first goal.", "published": 1481149320, "mapFileHistory": [{"filename": "WaterPolo_P_v1.udk", "fullHash": "a1a48d395b1252a2f434c87e3bd7f283", "updateTimestamp": 1481149320}]}, "2143716014": {"workshopId": "2143716014", "author": "Leth", "title": "Lethamyr's Hospital Hide n Seek", "desc": "Enjoy yet another Hide n Seek creation!", "published": 1593237360, "mapFileHistory": [{"filename": "LethHospitalHnS.udk", "fullHash": "08333a444bc128a6dcf5282e5a0805b4", "updateTimestamp": 1593237360}]}, "1906378036": {"workshopId": "1906378036", "author": "CoCo", "title": "Aim training (new update) - By CoCo", "desc": "Shoot the targets and try to get the max score by being as consistent as possibe!\n- Mods -\n~Easy~\nGoal sized target.

As of now, I'm not sure if I'll continue to add new features due to time constraints and UDK limitations. For now my focus will be to maintain this map as it is, so that means fixing bugs that have been introduced after a Rocket League update.\nThis map is meant to be played with 2-8 players. See \nRocket Launcher\n[rocketleaguemods.com]\n instructions for how to setup multiplayer.\nWhat is Tumble?\nInspired by the popular Rumble mode in Rocket League, Tumble is a round-robin style gamemode in which players from opposing teams take turns activating power-ups. Power-ups can alter the map in many ways, from objects obstructing goals to moving obstacles that disrupt gameplay. After ten seconds, a player is selected to activate a power-up (indicated by the HUD on the lower left corner of the screen and an arrow above the player's car). They'll have ten seconds to pickup (drive/fly into) one three random power-ups spread throughout the map.\ntl;dr it's like rumble, but for maps\nWhat kinds of power-ups are there?\nThere are currently five power-ups available.\n- The Wave: A hump that travels halfway across the map, launching anything that gets in its way.\n- The Wall: A wall that travels halfway across the map, blocking the activator's goal and restricting gameplay to the opposing team's half.\n- Pillars: Black rising pillars that partially obstruct the activator's goal.\n- Dropshot: Like the name suggests, a hole is opened on the opposing team's side, allowing a goal to be score there.\n- Hoops: Like the name suggests, a Hoops goal is activated on the activator's side. This one helps in that in blocks the default goal and makes it harder to score there, but also introduces the Hoops goal which can be harder to defend.\nIssues:\n- Boostpads not fully implemented\n- Pickups sometimes overlap each other\n- HUD doesn't always fully reset upon scoring a goal or reaching overtime\n- Hoops power-up is still buggy\nPlease post a comment if you find other issues.

Every single sequence is randomized and has variations. A duplicate variation is purely coincidental.\n- WARNING: You will not be able to save replays. Teleporting a player crashes the replays and this action is crucial to the workings of this map. Also, a replay over 30 minutes long tends to crash the game.\n- If you want to replay this map, restart from kickoff in match admin doesn't work. You will need to make a new lobby\n ONLY HOVER OVER THE BLACK BAR IF YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE GAME \nThe following is a spoiler: \n In the ending cutscene, one of the lines is, \"Was this sacrifice necessary?\" The answer to that question is \n no \n.
